# Features of the dataset  


# Introduction to the dataset  

This course uses data from a mock metagenome community published from [Ultra-deep, long-read nanopore sequencing of mock microbial community standards](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/5/giz043/5486468?login=true) which has long and short read sequencing data and has been used for benchmarking metagenome tools.
