In this lesson we will discuss how we define metagenomics and the challenges that do not arise in a non-metagenomic genomics experiment. We will cover logging into the amazon web instance you will use for metagenomic analyses, how to quality control your data before read assembly and assembling a metagenome. We will then cover how to assess the quality of the metagenome and how we can improve it by removing errors through _polishing_.
